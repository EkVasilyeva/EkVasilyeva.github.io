        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Kate!</h1>
				<p>I'm just a typical girl, who loves STEAM, cats, food, and everyone on this planet! I'm passionate to create something, that can affect the world or something that can make a big movement in the STEAM field. I'm a leader of the "Hack Club with Java" club, the first Hack Club in Connecticut, and planning to run at least one Hackathon in our state.</p>

			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Well, my name is Ekaterina Vasilyeva, but most of the people are just calling me Kate. I was born in Russia, Moscow and has already visited many countries in my life. I am a part of <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition team 178 and a leader of Hack Club at our high school. I'm living at Farmington, CT. It's a great place, with great people. I can describe myself as a very sensitive, but honest, kind, and helpful person. If anyone needs help, I'm always happy to help. I think my favorite quote is this one: "Just because you don't look like somebody who you think is attractive doesn't mean you aren't attractive. Flowers are pretty, but so are sunsets and they look nothing alike.". It does help a lot to me because I have allergies. Every time as I'm eating allergen, I'm starting to scratch my body. That's why I have a lot of scratches on my body. But I'm good now!</p>
			
			<h2>My Interests</h2>
			<p>As I said, I love science, technology, being kind and food. To be more specific, I'm a part of the _FIRST_ Robotics Competition team 178. This year I will be in programming because this is what I'm interested in. Also, I'm working on creating a first Hack Club at the state of Connecticut! I'm super motivated to do that, and I hope that this club will be successful. I'm also a part of the AV team, which means that I'm sometimes working with technical stuff at my school's events (running lights, audio, controlling camera's, etc.). I love what I'm doing at planning to have a career in science or technologies. I didn't know about that until I joined an FRC team, so I appreciate that I have this experience who opened my eyes on something, that I'm truly passionate about. There is much more that I can say, but it will take way too much time to talk about that.</p>
