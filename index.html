        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Kate!</h1>
				<p>I'm just a typical girl, who loves STEAM, cats, food, and everyone on this planet! I'm passionate to create something, that can affect the world or something that can make a big movement in the STEAM field. I'm a leader of the "Hack Club with Java" club, the first Hack Club in Connecticut, and planning to run at least one Hackathon in our state.</p>

			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Well, my name is Ekaterina Vasilyeva, but most of the people are just calling me Kate. I was born in Russia, Moscow and has already visited many countries in my life. I am a part of <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition team 178 and a leader of Hack Club at our high school. I'm living at Farmington, CT. It's a great place, with great people. I can describe myself as a very sensitive, but honest, kind, and helpful person. If anyone needs help, I'm always happy to help. I think my favorite quote is this one: "Just because you don't look like somebody who you think is attractive doesn't mean you aren't attractive. Flowers are pretty, but so are sunsets and they look nothing alike.". It does help a lot to me because I have allergies. Every time as I'm eating allergen, I'm starting to scratch my body. That's why I have a lot of scratches on my body. But I'm good now!</p>
