#My Interests

As I said, I love science, technology, being kind and food. To be more specific, I'm a part of the _FIRST_ Robotics Competition team 178. This year I will be in programming because this is what I'm interested in. Also, I'm working on creating a first Hack Club at the state of Connecticut! I'm super motivated to do that, and I hope that this club will be successful. I'm also a part of the AV team, which means that I'm sometimes working with technical stuff at my school's events (running lights, audio, controlling camera's, etc.). I love what I'm doing at planning to have a career in science or technologies.

I didn't know about that until I joined an FRC team, so I appreciate that I have this experience who opened my eyes on something, that I'm truly passionate about. There is much more that I can say, but it will take way too much time to talk about that. If you want to talk to me or get to know me, feel free to go the "Contact Me" page!
