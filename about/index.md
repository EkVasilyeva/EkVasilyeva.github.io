#About my life

###Well, my name is Ekaterina Vasilyeva, but most of the people are just calling me Kate. I was born in Russia, Moscow and has already  
visited many countries in my life. I am a part of _FIRST_ Robotics Competition team 178 and a leader of Hack Club at our high school.  
I'm living at Farmington, CT. It's great place, with a great people. I can describe myself as a very sensetive, but honest, kind, and  
helpful person. If anyone needs help, I'm always happy to help. I think my favorite quote is this one:

>"Just because you don't look like somebody who you think is attractive doesn't mean you aren't attractive. Flowers are pretty, but so  
are sunsets and they look nothing alike."

###It does help a lot to me, because I have allergies. Every time as I'm eating allergen, I'm atarting to scratch my body. That's why I  
have a lot of scratches on my body. But I'm good now! To see more info about me, see the "My Interesrs" page!
